```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

```
- WHEN the user clicks the button to generate a password, he/she is presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
- After answering each question, such as whether the user want's to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numerics, special characters and the length of the password, a random password is generated by the app.
